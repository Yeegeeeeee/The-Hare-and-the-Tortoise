(Turtle and Bird stand at the finish line, sweat dripping as they catch their breath. The air is filled with tension and relief.)
Bird:"You really did it… I underestimated you."(Panting) 
Turtle:"The race is over, Bird. But this is only the beginning."(Smiling)
Bird:"You may have won this time, but don’t think for a second that you’re better than me. Next time, I’ll take back the title."(Reluctantly) 
Turtle:"I’ll be waiting for you, Bird. Anytime."(Resolute) 
(The crowd erupts into cheers as the referee announces the results. Turtle raises the trophy, but his eyes betray a hint of unease. The impact of the "Time Orb" lingers in his thoughts—what did it truly change?)
