#;0;Bird;right;You? A mere human? You think you can beat me in a race?;1;;
#;1;Man;left;I’ve already beaten the rabbit. Now it’s your turn to see what I can do.;2;;
#;2;Bird;right;The rabbit? That overconfident fool practically handed you the win. I’m not like him.;3;;
#;3;Bird;right;Tell me, what’s your plan this time? Hoping I’ll trip over myself?;4;;
#;4;Man;left;I have my own strategy. Winning isn’t just about speed.;5;;
#;5;Bird;right;Strategy? That’s just a fancy word for being slow. Speed is everything!;6;;
&;6;;;Let’s see who wins.;9;focus@1;Man
&;7;;;Big talk for a bird.;10;courage@1;Man
&;8;;;I’ll give it everything I’ve got.;11;Determination@1;Man
#;9;Bird;right;Hah! Keep dreaming. You’ll be eating my dust before you know it.;12;;
#;10;Bird;right;Bold words. Let’s see if you can back them up!;12;;
#;11;Bird;right;At least you’re determined. Too bad it won’t be enough.;12;;
#;12;Bird;right;Just so you know, I’ve got a few surprises for you.;13;;
&;13;;;Tricks? Let’s see if they’re enough to beat me.;17;inspection@1;Man

#;17;Bird;right;Tricks? Strategy, my dear friend. You’ll learn soon enough why I’ll win.;20;;
#;18;Bird;right;Oh, I’ll bring it. But don’t cry when I leave you behind.;20;;
#;19;Bird;right;Worried? Hah! Let’s see who’s standing at the finish line.;20;;
#;20;Bird;right;Enough talk. Let’s see what you’re really made of!;24;;
#;21;Bird;right;Backing out already? Smart move. Not everyone’s cut out for this race.;22;;
&;22;Man;left;You win. I’m not ready for this challenge.;24;coward@1;Man
&;23;Man;left;Forget it. I’m not backing down!;24;;
END;24;;;;;;
