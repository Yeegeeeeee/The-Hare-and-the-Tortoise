#;0;Eagle;right;Officer, it’s terrible! This human fell off the cliff during our race!;1;;
#;1;Police;left;Fell off a cliff? What kind of race are you running here?;2;;
#;2;Eagle;right;It was just an unfortunate accident. I swear! I had nothing to do with it.;3;;
#;3;Police;left;This is the fourth person who has vanished after racing against you.;4;;
#;4;Eagle;right;Surely you’re not suggesting I had anything to do with that!;5;;
#;5;Police;left;I’m not suggesting… yet. But don’t leave town. I’ll need a statement from you later.;6;;
#;6;Eagle;right;Of course, Officer. I’m always ready to cooperate. Just let me know when.;7;;
#;7;Police;left;Let’s hope you’re telling the truth. I’ll contact you soon.;8;;
#;8;Eagle;right;Have a good day, Officer.;9;;
END;9;;;;;
